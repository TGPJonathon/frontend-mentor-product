## Overview

I recently finished a CSS course about a month or two ago, but I've been caught up with work stuff so I haven't practiced since then. Here's me getting back into it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid & Flex

### What I learned

I need to keep practicing CSS everyday or I will struggle and forget how to do things. It's been about 1-2 months since I last did a challenge, and I remember feeling like it was very easy. I thought this one would be the same, and eventually came to the conclusion I forgot a lot.

I did this one twice after stumbling onto a Kevin Powell video and realizing I could do better than my previous solution.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about Flexbox & Grid.
